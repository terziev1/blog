# Choose a simple color palete
Having a good color palete is key to being consistent in your UI.
Easiest way to create such a template is to use a pallete generator and try to limit it to around 5 different colors.
I usually go for a couple of main colors and some background ones as well. In the end it should look something like this:
-  primary
-  primary-dark
-  primary-light
-  accent
-  accent-dark
-  accent-light
-  bg-dark
-  bg-light

# Use fewer buttons and links

# Keep it familiar for the user

# Readable fonts are key.

# Less is more.. except for spacing.
